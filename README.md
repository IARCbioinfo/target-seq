# Calling mutations with needlestack on targeted sequencing data

This is the description of the IARC workflow to call somatic mutations with needlestack on targeted sequencing data.  
Usually, IARC data are generating with an IonTorrent Proton sequencer.  
Here samples are sequenced twice to remove library-preparation errors.  
This workflow contains 5 disctinct steps:

## STEP 1: local re-alignment with ABRA2

## STEP 2: coverage quality control with QC3

## STEP 3: variant calling with needlestack

## STEP 4: variant annotation with annovar

## STEP 5: post-filtering on bad samples/positions
